## Installation & Use
Straightforward.  As of the virtual environment, I chose to use Pipenv for package management because
of its performances compared to the old school venv.  All packages are included in its pipfile and pipfile.lock.
Here are the steps to start up (go to your directory where you want to set up the projet):
1. pip install --user pipenv
2. To activate the environment, just navigate to your project directory and use pipenv shell to launch a new shell session or use pipenv run <command> to run a command directly.
3.  Use a Pipenv project
If you download my project from GitHub repository, all you need to do is to unpack the contents of the repository into a directory and run pipenv install (no package names needed). Pipenv will read the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files for the project, create the virtual environment, and install all of the dependencies as needed.
4. From the commande line, run 'python manage.py runserver', and you are good to go :)
## Installation & Use
There are certain files that are not used for this project, but I kept them here for future uses in order to develop a more realistic project.  Thank you.
